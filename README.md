Project 3 by team 910_10b

To run the backend open the api folder and type "npm start" in terminal
Look at different routes inside backend by seeing the app.js file and there is a section of code with comments around it
    Example: "app.use('/testAPI', testAPIRouter);" means that localhost:9000/testAPI exists

    Run npm install react-modal
    npm install react-tsparticles
    npm install axiom
=======
Things to download for backend (download in the api folder):
    BEFORE DOING THIS JUST TRY TO RUN BECAUSE THEY SHOULD ALREADY BE DOWNLOADED IN THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER
    npm install express --save
    npm install pg --save
    npm install dotenv --save
